SparkCore.cs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cool names are beyond me.

I'm working on a C# library to interface with the Spark Core API. Not much so

Included files:

# Api.cs
# Json.cs
# README.txt

The C# code is being tested against the v1 key communicating with a Core using
firmware found at the following address: http://pastebin.com/Tsppy8ey
